# Title

Basic To-do list App.  
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.
 
## Description

The project is about keeping a to-do list.  
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
To-do list helps you get a handle on management of more long-term projects and plan ahead for the future.
By keeping a to-do list, you can make sure to track even the things you normally donâ€™t remember and things will get done very soon. 


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
